Hi! My name's Ciarán. I'm a technical writer and programmer based in Berlin.

I've been working with computers since I was very young and have made the mistake of making them my career. I sometimes take notes on the frustrations I come up against and complain about various things that have displeased me on any given day. I change my mind a lot, though, so don't be surprised if something I have previously praised ends up the subject of my ire.

In my spare time, I contribute to a few projects – notably [Funkwhale]. I also host a [popular Funkwhale pod][funkwhale-pod] for podcasters, musicians, and listeners.
