![Happy 2020][2020]

2019 was a bit of a rocky year, admittedly. With the country in which I reside resigning itself utterly to lunacy, my relationship ending, and a general descent in my mental health at several points due to work and existing issues, it is not a year I will necessarily look back on with much fondness. All is not, however, doom and gloom.

## Funky friends

Back in February of 2019 I started committing to [Funkwhale][funkwhale]. Initially I contributed only documentation, but as I spent more time with the application I started to get more involved with the codebase. I now regularly contribute small fixes and improvements, and I even sit on the association's steering committee.

Participating in Funkwhale has been an incredibly rewarding experience which I hope to keep going for as long as possible. In February, a whole year on from the start of my engagement with the project, I will be travelling to meet the collected association members in person!

## Hosting hijinks

Of course, 2019 was also the year that I got fully stuck into hosting my own services. While [Tanuki Tunes][tanukitunes] and Baku Social were technically spun up in December 2018, they didn't really start to see any traction until much later. I now host 4 public services (Mastodon, Funkwhale, Gitea, and Matrix) and a private [Streama][streama] instance for me and my dad. I had always been interested in self hosting, and I have to admit that I very much enjoy the challenge it presents. Tanuki Tunes has been particularly popular, gaining over 200 users over the course of the year :tada:

## Hopes for the future

I was recently given a new job, which will mean that I will be transitioning out of my current reactive support role and into a more constructive technical account management role. While not the development role I was hoping to get (in order to help me improve my coding knowledge), this role should leave me with more time to work on projects, better pay, and a chance to actually work a standard shift for once. No more tickets! No more tickets!

That is, of course, if the UK doesn't decide to completely tear itself apart over the next year…
