I've been having some fun learning Python recently as part of a course I'm doing. One of our early assignments was to create a simple saponification calculator which would return the amount of lye and water required to make soap from some given oils.

My personal goal in all of this is to be able to make graphical programs, as I always seem to fall at that hurdle. I've made terminal-based scripts and apps in the past, but have always given up with the creation of a GUI due to not understanding how on earth you get a front-end to talk to a back-end.

After spending some time with [Glade][glade] and the excellent [GTK developer documentation][gtk-docs] (and by time I mean I started this rewrite at 7PM and ended up with something workable at 7AM), I am finally getting a handle on how these things talk to one another and work together.

Something I'd never really considered was just how different interacting with applications in the terminal and on the front-end is. With a terminal app things are fairly sequential and predictable, but when you start putting things into an interface it becomes a completely different process. The [original script][original-script] essentially just ran through each part in sequence:

- Enter a value for olive oil
- Enter a value for coconut oil
- Select whether or not to use lye reduction
- Calculate results

But with a GUI application, it's possible to have all of the inputs accessible at once, and the expectation of the user will be to have either:

- A button that performs the calculation once everything is filled in
- A calculation performed whenever a value is changed

For the challenge of it, I opted for the latter, which meant that at every turn entries had to be sanitized and handled synchronously. What I had originally thought would be a simple case of just attaching a front end to a script basically left me with a completely different program with a different project structure and set of tools. The only thing that remained consistent was the maths.

I've learned a lot about Python recently, to the point where I'm starting to think about work projects in terms of how they could be simplified using the language. The important thing, I think, is to make sure I know ahead of time whether I expect to use a GUI or not, as it has a massive impact on how everything is set up.

I will say that there is a relatively small amount of documentation available for Python + Glade, and a lot of the documentation that is available is aging badly (Python 2.7, anyone?). However, a lot of the blanks can be filled in by reading documentation for Glade and other languages like C and Vala to get an idea of how the elements interact with the language, then simply convert that to your Python thinking.

Is [my code][source-code] good? No. It badly needs to be refactored and cleaned up. But for a 12-hour sprint with a tool I've never used before I'm pretty happy with it. Of course, the moment I use it on a different DE the theming falls apart but oh wellâ€¦

Next up: learning how to package this stuff.
