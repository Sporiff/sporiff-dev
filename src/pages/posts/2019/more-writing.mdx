## And now for something completely different

I've been writing posts on this website for a little while now, mostly relating to my technological exploits and sysadmin misadventures. While this is a big part of my life at the moment, it's not the only thing I do. I'm going to try and write a bit more about non-technology things just to try to encourage myself to focus on other things alongside computers.

## Why?

Basically, computers have started to take over my life. I go to work every day and work with computers, writing more SQL than I am comfortable with. I administer my Funkwhale and Mastodon servers, which – while something I very much enjoy doing – takes up a lot of my time and money since I am still working it out and am paying for it off my back. I also tend to come home and hop straight on a computer to do… something. There's not always a goal. Sometimes I just kind of mess around on 4chan or Reddit for a few hours every night before going to bed, achieving absolutely nothing in the limited amount of time I have free after spending far too long at work.

I have other interests that I'm keen to get back into. Chief among these is music, and I'm looking to get back into recording and posting music up on [Tanuki Tunes][tanukitunes] as a way of marrying up my passions. Another interest is writing. I've started brainstorming ideas for a short story I'd like to write, but I'm a pretty piss-poor writer when it comes to sticking to an idea, so I won't hold my breath on that. The last – and easiest of these to achieve – is reading. As a child I was a voracious reader, but as time has gone on I have simply stopped reading. It's not that I no longer enjoy it, it's more that I find myself simply not bothering because it's much more quickly gratifying to waste time on the computer every day. This is something I guess I just need to balance better, as I don't want to lose interest in computers at all, but it can't be my only pastime.

I'm probably going to post more ramblings here as it's an easy and safe way to rant about things in a more thought-out and constructive way than Mastodon. I used to very much enjoy having a blog. I should probably try to enjoy it again.

I'll be making changes to this site over the next few days.
