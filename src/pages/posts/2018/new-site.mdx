As the astute among you may have noticed, this site has undergone some changes over the last couple of days. That's because I've now completely moved away from Wordpress and destroyed my old server in favour of a different provider.

There are a couple of reasons for this:

1. The server was costing me money that I didn't have to spare
2. Wordpress is slow and cumbersome. Even a simple site like this was taking
   far too long to load
3. I wasn't _learning_ anything by using Wordpress

This last point is the reason I've moved to the solution I have. I'm now using [Netlify][netlify] in conjunction with [GitHub][github] to host my site and am writing everything in Markdown to be generated using [Hugo][hugo]. Why? Well, let's take each of these points in turn.

Firstly, I've been thinking about getting away from Wordpress for a while now. Secondly, while I have a few repos on GitHub, I am not exactly a git aficionado and really need to learn more for future reference. Thirdly, writing posts in WYSIWYG editors is just kind of a crutch at this point. Now that I'm spending more time getting to know Vim and LaTeX for home use, I feel like getting to know Markdown at the same time is a good idea. Lastly, I am just as guilty as many others of running a simple site with far too heavy an interface. There is no justification for a blog such as mine to run on WP when static pages will suffice.

I'm also going to be focusing more on RSS as this is a technology I would dearly like to keep alive. I know not everybody likes it, but as somebody who is finding themselves more and more living in a terminal it is an essential thing for me.

That's all for now. Hopefully this move isn't too jarring. If you prefer light themes, the lightbulb in the top right will switch you over. This site is dark by default because it's better for your eyes, yung'uns
